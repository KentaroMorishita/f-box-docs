title: Key Concepts
description: Overview of the foundational concepts in F-Box React, including `useBox` and `useRBox`.
---

F-Box React builds on the functional programming principles of F-Box, extending its capabilities to React applications. This section provides an overview of the core concepts and primary hooks used in F-Box React.

---

## Core Hooks

F-Box React introduces two primary hooks to integrate functional programming abstractions into React components:

1. **`useBox`**: Access and transform immutable values encapsulated in a `Box`.
2. **`useRBox`**: Manage reactive state with `RBox`, enabling seamless state updates and synchronization across components.

---

## Quick Overview

### `useBox`

The `useBox` hook allows React components to access and transform values stored in a `Box`. It is particularly useful for working with static or derived data that doesn't require frequent updates.

#### Example

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useBox } from "f-box-react"
import { Box } from "f-box-core"

const themeBox = Box.pack({ color: "blue", fontSize: 16 })

const ThemedComponent = () => {
  const [theme] = useBox(themeBox)

  return (
    <div style={{ color: theme.color, fontSize: theme.fontSize }}>
      Themed Text
    </div>
  )
}
```

### `useRBox`

The `useRBox` hook provides reactive state management in React, acting as a powerful alternative to `useState` for local and global state management.

#### Example

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useRBox } from "f-box-react"

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, countBox] = useRBox(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => countBox.setValue(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
