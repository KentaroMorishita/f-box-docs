description: Detailed API reference for the useRBox hook in F-Box React.
---

`useRBox` is a React hook that bridges the `RBox` abstraction from F-Box with React's ecosystem. It allows you to manage reactive state in React components with a declarative and functional programming approach.

---

The `useRBox` hook integrates the reactivity of `RBox` with React, enabling seamless state management for both local and global states. It leverages React's `useSyncExternalStore` for efficient updates and guarantees type safety with TypeScript.

### Key Features

- **Integration with `RBox`**: Manage reactive state directly in React components.
- **Global and Local State**: Supports both global shared state and component-specific state.
- **Type Safety**: Offers strong TypeScript support for predictable and error-free development.

---

## Creating a `useRBox` Hook

To use `useRBox`, pass either an initial value, an `RBox` instance, or a function that returns a value or `RBox`.

### Example

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useRBox } from "f-box-react"

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, countBox] = useRBox(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => countBox.setValue(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

## Supported Patterns

### Local Reactive State

Use `useRBox` to manage component-specific state.

```tsx
const [count, countBox] = useRBox(0)
countBox.setValue((prev) => prev + 1)
```

### Global Reactive State

Use `useRBox` with a shared `RBox` to manage state across multiple components.

```tsx
// globalState.ts
import { RBox } from "f-box-core"
export const counterBox = RBox.pack(0)
```

```tsx
// CounterDisplay.tsx
import React from "react"
import { useRBox } from "f-box-react"
import { counterBox } from "./globalState"

const CounterDisplay = () => {
  const [count] = useRBox(counterBox)
  return <p>Global Count: {count}</p>
}
```

```tsx
// CounterControls.tsx
import React from "react"
import { counterBox } from "./globalState"

const CounterControls = () => {
  const increment = () => counterBox.setValue((count) => count + 1)

  return <button onClick={increment}>Increment Global Count</button>
}
```

## API Methods

### useRBox

#### `useRBox<T>(source: T | RBox<T> | (() => T | RBox<T>), deps?: React.DependencyList): [T, RBox<T>]`

Creates an `RBox` and returns its value along with the `RBox` instance.

#### Parameters

- **`source`**:
  - An initial value, an `RBox` instance, or a function returning a value or `RBox`.
- **`deps`**:
  - A dependency array for memoization. The `RBox` is recomputed when dependencies change.

#### Returns

- **`value`**:
  - The current value encapsulated in the `RBox`.
- **`rbox`**:
  - The `RBox` instance itself.

---

## Use Cases

### Using `RBox` for Local State

Manage local reactive state within a single component.

```tsx
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, countBox] = useRBox(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => countBox.setValue((prev) => prev + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using `RBox` for Global State

Share state across multiple components using `RBox`.

```tsx
// globalState.ts
import { RBox } from "f-box-core"
export const counterBox = RBox.pack(0)
```

#### Access it in different components:

```tsx
// CounterDisplay.tsx
import React from "react"
import { useRBox } from "f-box-react"
import { counterBox } from "./globalState"

const CounterDisplay = () => {
  const [count] = useRBox(counterBox)
  return <p>Global Count: {count}</p>
}
```

```tsx
// CounterControls.tsx
import React from "react"
import { counterBox } from "./globalState"

const CounterControls = () => {
  const increment = () => counterBox.setValue((count) => count + 1)

  return <button onClick={increment}>Increment Global Count</button>
}
```

## Why Use `useRBox`?

The `useRBox` hook provides a powerful and type-safe way to manage state in React applications. It combines the reactivity of `RBox` with React's component-based architecture, making it ideal for building scalable and maintainable applications.
