# Welcome to F-Box

F-Box is a library designed to bring the power of functional programming to your JavaScript and React applications. It provides a set of core abstractions for handling values, state, and asynchronous computations in a clean and predictable way.

## Key Features

- **Composable Abstractions**: Use functional constructs like `Box`, `Maybe`, `Either`, and `Task` to compose your logic effectively.
- **Type Safety**: Ensure correctness with TypeScript support, helping you catch errors at compile time.
- **Reactivity**: Seamlessly manage reactive state using `RBox` and integrate it with your UI components.

## Why Use F-Box?

Modern applications often require handling complex state, asynchronous flows, and edge cases like missing values or errors. F-Box simplifies these challenges by providing a consistent and functional API.

### Examples of Use Cases

- **State Management**: Use `RBox` to manage reactive state with ease.
- **Error Handling**: Handle success and failure scenarios explicitly with `Either`.
- **Optional Values**: Safely deal with missing data using `Maybe`.
- **Asynchronous Workflows**: Compose asynchronous tasks with `Task`.
